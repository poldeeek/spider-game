# Spider Game
> Simple game in React (SSR in plans) craeted from scratch (without CRA). 
> I didn't use any third-part libraries or html5 canvas elements for computer graphics.

> [Spider Game Demo Site](https://poldeeek.github.io/spider-game/)

> At this moment application is only for client side. I want to create a simple server which would render that application (SSR). 
> That's why the application is in `frontend` folder for now.
